intro: |
  Passionate about artificial intelligence and its applications, I have chosen to pursue a Master of Science in applied mathematics at Ecole Polytechnique, one of the best engineering schools in France.  
  
  Furthermore, I believe that getting our hands dirty is the best way to learn. As a result, I am constantly striving to expand my knowledge in this sector by covering as many topics as possible on my own.  

  Currently, I collaborate on one of [Omdena](https://omdena.com/)’s projects with a team of more than forty data science enthusiasts to build an AI‑powered product to reduce traffic accidents in Liverpool.
